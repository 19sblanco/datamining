Data mining is the study of efficiently finding structures and patterns in large data sets. We will focus on several aspects of this: (1) converting from a messy and noisy raw data set to a structured and abstract one, (2) applying scalable and probabilistic algorithms to these well-structured abstract data sets, and (3) formally modeling and understanding the error and other consequences of parts (1) and (2), including choice of data representation and trade-offs between accuracy and scalability. These steps are essential for training as a data scientist.
Algorithms, programming, probability, and linear algebra are required tools for understanding these approaches.
Topics will include: similarity search, clustering, regression/dimensionality reduction, graph analysis, PageRank, and small space summaries. We will also cover several recent developments, and the application of these topics to modern applications, often relating to large internet-based companies.
Upon completion, students should be able to read, understand, and implement ideas from many data mining research papers.

Learning Objectives: On completion of this course students will be able to:
convert a structured data set (like text) into an abstract data representation such as a vector, a set, or a matrix, with modeling considerations, for use in downstream data analysis
implement and analyze touchstone data mining algorithms for clustering, dimensionality reduction, regularized regression, graph analysis, and locality sensitive hashing.
understand, discuss, and evaluate advanced data mining algorithms for clustering, dimensionality reduction, regularized regression, graph analysis, locality sensitive hashing, and managing noisy data.
work with team to design and execute a multi-faceted data mining project on data which is not already structured for the analysis task, and to compare and evaluate the design choices.
present progress and final results using written, oral, and visual media on a data analysis project to peers in small groups, to peers in large interactive environment, and to get approval from a superior.
